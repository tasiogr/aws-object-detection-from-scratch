## Prerequisites
In order to run this solution you need:
 - Python 3.x
 - The [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed and configured with permissions to:
   - Create CloudFormation stacks.
   - Create an S3 bucket.
   - Create/update Lambda functions.
   - Attach an IAM policy to the DeepLensGreengrassGroupRole role.
   - List and get Greengrass groups certificate authorities.
 - [AWS SAM CLI installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
 - An Amazon S3 bucket to which you have write access.
  
## How to deploy the Lambda functions
Clone or download this Git repository to a local directory and follow the instructions below.

### Mac/Linux users
1. Give execution permissions to the .sh files in the ./deeplens/deployment directory
```
chmod +x ./deeplens/deployment/*.sh
```
2. Run the following commands from the **deeplens/deployment** directory (substitute the arguments between <> with appropriate ones):

```./deploy-capture-function.sh --bucket <your-s3-bucket-name> --stack-name <your-stack-name>```
```./deploy-inference-function.sh --bucket <your-s3-bucket-name> --stack-name <your-stack-name>```


### Windows users

1. Open a terminal window
   1. Press windows key + r
   2. Introduce cmd and press enter
2. Go to the **deeplens/deployment** folder and run the following commands:
   1. ```sam build -t capture-template.yaml```
   2. ```sam package --region us-east-1 --s3-bucket <your-s3-bucket> --output-template-file packaged-template.yaml;``` (substitute  ```<your-s3-bucket>``` with the S3 bucket name where SAM can upload the package)
   3. ```sam deploy --region us-east-1 --template-file ./packaged-template.yaml --stack-name <your-stack-name> --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM;``` (substitute ```<your-stack-name>``` with an appropriate name for your CloudFormation Stack)

## How to run the trigger application

This application requires the following Python packages:
 - OpenCV (```pip install python-opencv```)
 - AWS IoT Device SDK for Python (```pip install awsiotpythonsdk```)
 - Numpy (```pip install numpy```)

Once you have registered an AWS IoT Thing, download the private key and the certificate and place them in the **trigger/certs** folder.
Rename the private key file to ```private.pem.key``` and the certificate file to ```certificate.pem.crt```.

You also need the certificate of the root CA in the Greengrass group of your DeepLens.

### Download the Greengrass Group CA certificate

1. Go to the Greengrass Console and click on Groups. Click on the DeepLens group and then on Settings.
2. Copy the Group ID.
3. Open the *get_gg_ca_cert.py* file in your favorite text editor and substitute ```<YOUR_GREENGRASS_GROUP_ID>``` with the Group Id you copied.
4. Go to the **trigger** directory and run ```python src/get_gg_ca_cert.py```

### Run the trigger application

1. Go to the **trigger/src** directory and run ```python trigger_app.py```
2. The application will open a new window that may be hidden, so switch applications (alt+tab) and you'll see a Python application.
3. Once in that window, click *'y'* to save a picture, *'q'* to quit the application, or any other key to ignore the current picture and request a new one.
